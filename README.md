# 16-Bit Homemade Computer

A complete 16-bit computer system built from scratch, featuring custom hardware, a complete software toolchain, and interactive peripherals. This project demonstrates computer architecture principles through practical implementation.
The build process is shown in this video [![Video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/R3bKXx0AeOo/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3bKXx0AeOo)

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The computer consists of several interconnected components:

- **16-bit CPU** with instruction set from From Nand to Tetris course
- **FPGA-based RAM** system with 50MHz clock
- **STM32 EEPROM programmer** for code storage
- **Peripheral interface** with display, sound, and input systems
- **Complete software toolchain** from high-level language to machine code

## üõ†Ô∏è Hardware Components

This computer was mainly built with 74LS series chips. Because the instruction set expects the RAM to behave like a register, FPGA was used to emulate the RAM.
Because of the wiring, routing, EMI etc., this version is not stable enough to run high level language such as the Jack language from From Nand to Tetris course.

## üíª Modular Design

The individual modules were designed in Digital circuit simulator. The designs are under digital-files folder. Some modules have output buffer which was not implemented on the physical boards.

Note that much of the code in this project was generated by AI (including this README).
