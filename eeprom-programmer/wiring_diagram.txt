Power Distribution:
------------------
5V from Arduino Nano -> 74LS595 #1 VCC
5V from Arduino Nano -> 74LS595 #2 VCC
5V from Arduino Nano -> 28C256 VCC (Pin 28)
GND from Arduino Nano -> 74LS595 #1 GND
GND from Arduino Nano -> 74LS595 #2 GND
GND from Arduino Nano -> 28C256 GND (Pin 8)

Important Notes:
---------------
1. All components must share the same 5V and GND
2. The 74LS595 shift registers are cascaded (Q7 of first connects to DS of second)
3. Both shift registers share the same clock (SHCP) and latch (STCP) signals
4. The data bus (D0-D7) is bidirectional - Arduino switches between input/output mode
5. Control signals (WE, OE, CE) are active low
6. Address lines A0-A14 are driven by the shift registers
7. The 28C256 has a limited number of write cycles (~100,000)
8. Pin 13 is avoided due to built-in LED and resistor that can interfere with digital operations
9. Data bus starts at pin 5 to avoid pin 13 conflict

Timing Considerations:
---------------------
- Shift register clock frequency should not exceed 25MHz
- Write operations require proper timing (WE pulse width)
- Read operations are much faster than write operations
- Write completion is detected by polling the data bus
